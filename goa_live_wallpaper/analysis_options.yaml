# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# Minimal analysis options to avoid dependency on flutter_lints
# include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml  # Commented out since no external lints

    # Basic rules can be added here if needed
